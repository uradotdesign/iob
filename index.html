              <h3>libcamera</h3>
              <p>
                Supporting cameras within the V4L2 subsystem has grown in complexity. We created 'libcamera' as a fully featured camera stack for Linux, ChromeOS and Android to help facilitate the
                management and control of image acquisition, image processing algorithms and integration into applications.

              <h3>UVC Gadget</h3>
              <p>
                The benefit of the 'no-additional-drivers-required' ubiquity of UVC, makes it a great choice to connect your video streams to a host PC. We maintain and develop the UVC gadget drivers
                for the Linux kernel and provide a support library and sample application for you to integrate and expose your custom use cases.

              <h3>UVC</h3>
              <p>
                USB connected cameras are ubiquitous and well supported in Linux through the use of UVC (USB Video Class). Ideas on Board created and continues to maintain the UVC drivers for Linux in
                the V4L2 subsystem.

                Ideas on Board continue to work with partners and silicon vendors to support and create kernel drivers for image sensors, MIPI CSI2 receviers and Image Signal Processors to manage the
                hardware
